# FishingInDenmark
The reason I want the develop this app is because I am a fishermen and I find it very difficult to find fishing spots in Denmark. 
For this reason, I decided to develop an application that lets you see the different lakes from Denmark, the associations that own it, the different fish species from the specific lakes, and also the location of the lakes.
